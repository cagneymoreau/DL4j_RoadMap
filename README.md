#Machine Learning RoadMap for DL4J

This is a collection of progressively harder projects that I learned on and you can review or fix. Some are missing flawed etc
When I set out to learn I didnt plan on writing this so its a very ugly collections. The only advantage It has
over other learning sources is the chronological progression and my snappy comments!


If you want to add something to this please don't hesitate to let me know.
Some of the more interesting things don't work so If you see an error let me know
