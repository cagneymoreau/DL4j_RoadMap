#Machine Learning RoadMap for DL4J

As a much younger man, around 9 months ago, I began to research the alchemy of machine learning.
I bumped my head a few times along the way and to ease someone elses transition Im leaving this here.
Its a collection of progressively harder projects that I learned on and you can tackle. Some are missing flawed etc
When I set out to learn I didnt plan on writing this so its a very ugly collections. The only advantage It has
over other learning sources is the chronological progression and my snappy comments!


If you want to add something to this please don't hesitate to let me know.
Somr of the more interesting things dont work so If you see an error that would be really cool
