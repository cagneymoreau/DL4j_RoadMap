Machine Learning RoadMap for DL4J

As a much younger man, around 9 months ago, I began to research the alchemy of machine learning.
I bumped my head a few times along the way and to ease someone elses transition Im leaving this here.
Its a collection of progressively harder projects that I learned on and you can tackle. Some are missing flawed etc
When I set out to learn I didnt plan on writing this so its a very ugly collections. The only advantage It has
over other learning sources is the chronological progression and my snappy comments!

If you want to add something to this please dont hesitate to let me know.



1) BigPicture.txt (Also posted on my blog cagneymoreau.com/dl4j-roadmap
    - math
    - hand coded net

2) Download the DL4J examples and test some stuff out for fun

3) Working with INDarrays and datasets

3) Feed Forward Linear Regression and minibatch

4) MLP ClassifierLinear -Use the DL4J Example

3) Feed Forward Logistic Regression and saving network

4) Debuging Basic - Pulling Weights and Gradients

4) Recurrent Regression

5) Dual LSTM and csv manipulation

6) OverFitting and BenchMarking against examples

7) Early Stopping

9)Convolutions Cifar -Use the DL4J example

8) autoencoder/unsupervised

8) Custom loss function

9) Reinforcement learning and weight sharing
