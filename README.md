#Machine Learning RoadMap for DL4J

This is a collection of progressively harder projects that I learned on and you can review or fix. Some are missing flawed etc
When I set out to learn I didnt plan on writing this so its a very ugly collections.
Its sequential in nature so it should be a good roadmap for someone else.


If you want to add something to this please don't hesitate to let me know.
Im trying to touch on each broad category of machine learning.

Some of the more interesting things don't work or are a work in progress.
Also let me know if you want to team up on a harder project or find bugs here.


### BigPicture.txt
   If your a newb what to expect

### Download the DL4J examples and test some stuff out for fun
https://github.com/eclipse/deeplearning4j-examples

### Working with INDarrays and datasets
done

### basic stat exercises
thought these would be cool

### Feed Forward Linear Regression and minibatch
done

### CSVClassifierLinear
not included I used the dl4j example repo

### Feed Forward Logistic Regression and saving network
done

### Debuging Basic - Pulling Weights, params & Gradients
done

### Recurrent Regression and split DataSet
done with bug

### Dual LSTM and csv manipulation
 done two contrived examples of
        simple stock trader design

### OverFitting/EarlyStopping & nontrivial split dataset
done stock example extended

### Convolutions Cifar
not included I used the dl4j example repo

### autoencoder/unsupervised
done stocks example

### vae

### network/hper params testing/tuning

### convolution autoencoder
done celeb a dataset

### GrowAble Gan and weight sharing and comp graph debug
super important idea because it shows how networks can start learning
simple things and advance to more complicated without direct intervention
-- Ony makes modern art at the moment


### Reinforcement learning, custom loss  functions, BenchMarking against examples
separate git
https://github.com/cagneymoreau/ReinforcmentLearning


### Convolution Layer Viewers
Use the two different style of networks and view
the activations maps or the filters maximizations


### image segmentation
Use the Oxford-IIIT Pets dataset to perform segmentation and classification
opening tar.gz too
U-Net



### word object embedding


### Attention, Transformer, pervasive attention and NLP
vectorization and basic concept of dimensional tunneling vs static structure

### sparse training rigl


### Simplification/ Quantization
prado pqrnn realm
quantization fp to int


### transfering models



### object detection ILR/ efficientdet/ affordance
